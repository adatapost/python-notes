Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators are used to manipulate the bit pattern of integral value.

& bitwise operator - It tests whether the given bit is on or off
| bitwise operator - It set the bit (turn off bit into on bit)
^ bitwise exclusive or - It turn on a off bit and vice-versa
<< shift left -- It inserts off bit(s) at left of the binary pattern
>> shift right -- It inserts off bit(s) at right of the binary pattern

Assume that there are Eight gates in our city and status of each gate is defined via 1 and 0 -- 1 means open and 0 means close

Example:

>>>no = 0      # 1 byte = 8 bits 
               
Will turn off all bits,

128  64   32  16  8  4   2   1
 8   7     6  5   4  3   2  1   Bit Position
 0   0     0  0   0  0   0  0   Bit value

>>>no = 4    # Open the 3rd gate 

  0  0  0  0   0  1   0  0  Open 3rd gate

We can directly assign integer value to the object to form the bit pattern but now we want to open another gate - number 6 without affecting other gates:

   We can't set this -->>> no = 32  <-- This will erase 3rd bit


Example:
>>>bin(10)   # bin() function convert integer to ninary
0b1010
>>>no = 10
>>>if no & 8: 
      print("On")
   else:
      print("Off")

Above snippet check 4th bit and prints "On" 

| bitwise or operator to turn on the bit
>no = 10
>bin(no)
>no = no & 16   # Turn on 5th bit
>bin(no)
>no = no & 128  # Turn on 8th bit
>bin(no)

^ Exclusive or operator

  bit1   ^  bit2   = Result
    1    ^   1     =  0
    0    ^   0     =  0
    1    ^   0     =  1
    0    ^   1     =  1
>1 ^ 1
>0b1010 ^ 0b1010
>0b1010 ^ 0b0010
 

Integer Number to binary, hexadecimal and octal via bin(), hex() and oct() built-in functions
------------------------------------
>no = 10
>bin(no)
>hex(no)
>oct(no)
>bin(65535)
>hex(65535)

We can express integer literal using 0b (binary), 0x (hexa) and 0o(octal) prefix:

>0b10100
>0xAAA
0o1232

Example: City has eight gate controlled by the operator. Write a program to check whether the given gate is opened or closed.

Example: Write a program to accept gate number and open it
Example: Write a program to accept gate number and close it
