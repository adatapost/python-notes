Introduction to Programming
============================


What do you meant by the term "Methodology" or "Paradigm"?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Methodology or Paradigm refers to the "program design method". 

There are number of "program design" method around us and we will have to learn about two of the following:

  1. Procedure oriented paradigm (or Imperative or structured programming) 
	
  2. Object-oriented paradigm

Procedure oriented paradigm/programming
---------------------------------------
 -> It focus on functions/procedures/routies development 
 -> The "function" is the smallest executable unit.
 -> Normally, a problem (program) break down into two or more units.
 -> To reuse the code -- function is more sutable.

Object Oriented Paradigm
------------------------

-> An object means collection of reserved bytes (RAM). The size of an object
   can be vary from 1 byte to 4GB and many more.
-> In this approach (or paradigm), small objects are created and composite 
   and then form another object.
-> An object can bind the actions. For example, 
     Date object has date & time related functions.
     Number object has numberic actions like addition, subtraction, multiplication
	and so on.
-> To define an object, we must have to define "TYPE or datatype" first.
-> A "TYPE or datatype" is blue print of an object.
	For example,
		10-10-2002     data or object belongs to Date
-> A "Type" is also an "identity" of an object.

		e.g.    int a,b,c;
			float d;
		The "d" is float and "a,b,c" are int objects.		 

Computer languages: There are two types of computer languages.
-----------------
1. Low level - It uses binary number system for data & instructions
2. High level - It uses English like syntax for data & instructions.

C Language is "middle" level language because  it offers both; low and high level language features.

What is source program?
------------------------
A "program" that is written by the human using a programming language is called "Source" program.

What about the "Object Program"?
--------------------------------
A "program" that contains "binary insturctions" either written by the human or produced by the compiler is known as "object" program.

Object program sometime refer as "Native code". (Native means operating system specific instructions).

Flush or eat chars from  input keyboard buffer
-------------------------------------------------
 

int main()
{
   int n;
   char ch;

   printf("No : "); 
   scanf("%d",&n);
    
   printf("Name : ");
   while( (ch=getchar()) !='\n' );

   scanf("%c",&ch);
   printf("\n%d  %c  %d",n,ch,ch);
   return 0;
 }
